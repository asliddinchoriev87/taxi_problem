The Taxi-v3 environment simulates a simple grid world where an agent (a taxi) must pick up a passenger at one location and drop them off at a destination. The environment is a 5x5 grid, and the taxi can move in four directions (north, south, east, west), pick up a passenger, and drop off the passenger.
